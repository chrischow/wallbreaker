# WallBreaker
 WallBreaker is a [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) app that enables you to break past paywalls and overcome your monthly reading limits for articles on popular news sites.

WallBreaker is not novel. Anyone can overcome the paywalls through private browsing or browser extensions. Besides, the content is actually delivered to your browser, except that it is embedded in the webpage's source code in an inconvenient fashion. WallBreaker merely extracts that information.w
